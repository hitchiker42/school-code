I added in some code to the test data layout file to make the double pointer
function work. I created a new double pointer which just gives a new view to the
underlying data in the matrix A. I also added in a few asserts to the matrix.c
file. I'm not sure what we're really supposed to do for this homework, beyond
understanding the idea of pointers and structs and the like. There is one
problem with the code, for whatever reason, on my computer at least, the test
data layout code with the fortran added gets a segfault, only after everything
has printed out though, which is a bit odd.
