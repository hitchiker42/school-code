Code For School Progams

=====================

Author: Tucker DiNapoli
Date of inital commit: Jan 29, 2013

Contains code for school classes, as of now only cs671 & iam751
but should be fine to add any additional classes.

cs671 has 2 java programs, a guessing game and a testing program

iam751 has a simple hello program and a linear algebra libary with a test suite
