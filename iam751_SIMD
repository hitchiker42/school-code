Notes:
    X86_64 processors have several instruction sets, general purpose
        instructions,x87 fp instructions, MMX instructions SSE instructions
        SSE2 instructions, SSE3,SSSE3 &SSE4 instructions & AVX instructions
        (maybe more?).
    MMX registers aliased to x87 registers, no floating point calculations
        at the same time as MXX calculations
    Small data used, lots of small calculations, have 2 overflow modes,
        saturated or wraparound
