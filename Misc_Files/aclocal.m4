# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVA
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Here is a summary of the main macros:
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVAC: finds a Java compiler.
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVA: finds a Java virtual machine.
#
#   AX_CHECK_CLASS: finds if we have the given class (beware of CLASSPATH!).
#
#   AX_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS: finds if we have the given class and stops
#   otherwise.
#
#   AX_TRY_COMPILE_JAVA: attempt to compile user given source.
#
#   AX_TRY_RUN_JAVA: attempt to compile and run user given source.
#
#   AX_JAVA_OPTIONS: adds Java configure options.
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVA tests an existing Java virtual machine. It uses the
#   environment variable JAVA then tests in sequence various common Java
#   virtual machines. For political reasons, it starts with the free ones.
#   You *must* call [AX_PROG_JAVAC] before.
#
#   If you want to force a specific VM:
#
#   - at the configure.in level, set JAVA=yourvm before calling AX_PROG_JAVA
#
#     (but after AC_INIT)
#
#   - at the configure level, setenv JAVA
#
#   You can use the JAVA variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAVA@.
#
#   *Warning*: its success or failure can depend on a proper setting of the
#   CLASSPATH env. variable.
#
#   TODO: allow to exclude virtual machines (rationale: most Java programs
#   cannot run with some VM like kaffe).
#
#   Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
#   It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
#   on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
#   concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVA_CC
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Finds the appropriate java compiler on your path. By preference the java
#   compiler is gcj, then jikes then javac.
#
#   The macro can take one argument specifying a space separated list of
#   java compiler names.
#
#   For example:
#
#     AX_PROG_JAVA_CC(javac, gcj)
#
#   The macro also sets the compiler options variable: JAVA_CC_OPTS to
#   something sensible:
#
#    - for GCJ it sets it to: @GCJ_OPTS@
#      (if GCJ_OPTS is not yet defined then it is set to "-C")
#
#    - no other compiler has applicable options yet
#
#   Here's an example configure.in:
#
#     AC_INIT(Makefile.in)
#     AX_PROG_JAVA_CC()
#     AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)
#     dnl End.
#
#   And here's the start of the Makefile.in:
#
#     PROJECT_ROOT      := @srcdir@
#     # Tool definitions.
#     JAVAC             := @JAVA_CC@
#     JAVAC_OPTS        := @JAVA_CC_OPTS@
#     JAR_TOOL          := @jar_tool@

# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
#
# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
